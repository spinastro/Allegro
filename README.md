# Allegro
**Allegro** is a pipeline for the fast and fully automatic reduction of HARPS spectra. 

This pipeline has been used to reduce spectra analysed for a number of scientific projects, including [Spina et al. (2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...895...52S/abstract), and [Casali et al. 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...639A.127C/abstract).

[Here](https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/instruments/harps.html) you can find more information about the HARPS spectrograph.
